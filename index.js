  "Bananas float in water, as do apples and watermelons.",
  "Hawaii is the only place in the U.S. where bananas are grown commercially, although at one time they were also grown in southern California and Florida. The overwhelming majority of the bananas Americans eat come from countries in Latin America and South America, including Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia, Honduras, Panama, and Guatemala.",
  "The type of banana you see in the supermarket is called a Cavendish banana. The preferred variety was originally the Gros Michel, which essentially became extinct by 1960, thanks to a fungus called Panama disease.",
  "Some cultures (most notably Japan) use the fiber in the banana plant to make fabric and sometimes even paper.",
  "The fastest marathon ever run by a competitor dressed as a fruit was 2 hours, 58 minutes, and 20 secondsâ€”recorded at the Barcelona Marathon on March 6, 2011. The runner was Patrick Wightman from the United Kingdom, who dressed as a banana."
